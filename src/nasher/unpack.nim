  Usage:
    nasher unpack [options] <file>

  Description:
    Unpacks <file> into the project source tree.

    Each extracted file is checked against the source tree (as defined in the
    [Package] section of the package config). If the file exists in one location,
    it is copied there, overwriting the existing file. If the file exists in
    multiple folders, you will be prompted to select where it should be copied.

    If the extracted file does not exist in the source tree already, it is checked
    against each pattern listed in the [Rules] section of the package config. If
    a match is found, the file is copied to that location.

    If, after checking the source tree and rules, a suitable location has not been
    found, the file is copied into a folder in the project root called "unknown"
    so you can manually move it later.

    If an unpacked source would overwrite an existing source, you will be prompted
    to overwrite the file. The newly unpacked file will have a modification time
    less than or equal to the modification time of the file being unpacked. If the
    source file is newer than the existing file, the default is to overwrite the
    existing file.

  Options:
    --yes, --no    Automatically answer yes/no to the overwrite prompt
    --default      Automatically accept the default answer to the overwrite prompt

  Global Options:
    -h, --help     Display help for nasher or one of its commands
    -v, --version  Display version information

  Logging:
    --debug        Enable debug logging
    --verbose      Enable additional messages about normal operation
    --quiet        Disable all logging except errors
    --no-color     Disable color output (automatic if not a tty)
